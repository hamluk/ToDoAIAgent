Alright, here’s what we need to focus on this week.  
First, the new marketing campaign assets must be finalized by Thursday — Sarah is handling the visuals, but we still need copy approval.  
Next, please schedule a meeting with the design team early next week to review the new layout ideas.  
Also, we promised the client a summary report of the last sprint by Friday morning.  
Don’t forget to clean up the outdated Trello cards from the “Backlog” column; they’re causing confusion.  
Finally, start preparing a draft for the Q4 roadmap presentation, ideally by the end of the month.  
Oh, and update the budget forecast once the latest ad spend numbers are in — probably early next week.
